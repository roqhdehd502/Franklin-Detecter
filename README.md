This is my first project as Deep Learning.

- Prepare three kinds images(Franklin Clintion, Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips)
- Load images(100*100*3/Train:360EA/Test:240EA)
- Image Preproccessing
- Set a CNN with NNN(Namin Neural Network)
- Set a Optimizer(Adam)
- Set Epochs and Batch(1000 times, 1080 sizes)
- Save a training files(Check the Loss rate)
- Load training files and Activate testing
- Check the results(Accuracy rate)
