This is my first project as Deep Learning.

- Prepare three kinds images
- Load images(100x100x3/Train:1461/Test:490)
- Image Preproccessing
- Set a CNN with NNN(Namin Neural Network)
- Set a Optimizer(Adam)
- Set Epochs and Batch(1000, 1261)
- Save a training files(with Tensorboard)
- Load training files and Activate testing
- Check the results(Accuracy rate, Epoch-Loss Graph)
